<section class="mid-low">'I dedicated this website to Frank as he inspired me to start coding.
    He spoke about free resources people can use to start coding and said anyone could do it. He also spoke about his career and how he worked at many different companies
    including Netflix and IBM. This lead to him retiring comfortably at 30! I created this website as it was an assignment in The Odin Project and i could 
    create a website of any theme, which led me to make one about Frankniu.'
